                <p>Goddess Durga represents the united front of all devine forces against all negative forces.
Bengalies all over the world during the days of Durga Puja rejoice to their heartâ€™s content reconnecting with friends and families.
Durga Puja is an occasion when the familiar sound of Dhak , Dhunuchi nachh, the fragrance of incense gives familiar tug to every Bengali heart.
Uta Chatterjee and Robin Chatterjee along with friends were able to create home away from home feeling at the mandap of Kitchener Waterloo 2010.
The best part of Durga Puja is kichuri bogh which is prepared and served with great love.  

Year 2018 when Kitchener Waterloo (KWGC ) Cultural Group welcomed Maa Durga Protima from Kolkata a moment cherished by everyone who made this possible. 
We welcomes around 300 guests throughout the day.  This gave us more encouragement to continue.
