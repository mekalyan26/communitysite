              Goddess Durga represents the united front of all divine forces
              against all negative forces. Bengalies all over the world during
              the days of Durga Puja rejoice to their heartâ€™s content
              reconnecting with friends and families. Durga Puja is an occasion
              when the familiar sound of Dhak , Dhunuchi nachh, the fragrance of
              incense gives a familiar tug to every Bengali heart. Uta
              Chatterjee and Robin Chatterjee along with friends were able to
              create home away from home feeling at the mandap of Kitchener
              Waterloo in 2010.

              The best part of Durga Puja is kichuri bogh which is prepared and
              served with great love.

              Year 2018 was when Kitchener Waterloo (KWGC ) Bengali Cultural
              Group welcomed Maa Durga Protima from Kolkata, a moment cherished
              by everyone who made this possible. We welcomed around 300 guests
              throughout the day. This gave us more encouragement to continue.
